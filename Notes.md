# Overall

Good shape for monday

## Startup

Yay, it works.

# Tests

Fix them. ...BUT

You have a nice variety and you should talk about what you know about the 3
different types: educate your audience and talk about the benefits of what it
saved you (Matt!)

Remove `spec_helper` : don't cargo-cult that shit.

## JS Tests

Remove the stuff you don't need e.g. Jasmine test frameowrk

## Your nascent Gem

You have tests in the specs/game directory.  You'll want to extract those into
a gem.  ALSO: fwiw, you'd probably want to keep this under spec/models/ because
these are actually model tests, but since you're going to extract them anyway,
no bother, but just y'know, b-t-dubs and all.

## What's extras/ ?

Remove it

## Seeds

Good stuff in here. Extract the data to a data file.

## Keep your indentation clear in the view
